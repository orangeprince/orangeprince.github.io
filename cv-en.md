### Projects

#### User Profile Mining System for Tencent Users (2014.3 - Present)
 
In this project, I am response for designing the user label system, developing label mining algorithm and promoting the use of labels in the business.
The mining process is based on user data in tencent including structural user data, user social networks, user generated content, lbs data, etc.
Various methods have been tried or applied during the mining process, such as different classifers, clustering and topic modeling methods, text mining technologies, complex network, etc. The user labels not only cover basic user profiles including career, marital and wealth status, but also Relates to plenty of user interests, such as sports, music and tourism. The user labels have been used by different business including advertisement targeting, recommendation system and credit reporting. 

#### Yingyongbao mobile App Recomendation System (2013.12 - 2014.6)
Yingyongbao(应用宝) is a mobile software distribution platforms ownered by tencent. In this project, I'm response for designing and developing 
recommendation algorithms for mobile app recomendation. Plenty of state-of-the-art recomendation algotihms have been used in this system. In addition, I also make a lot of efforts to improve the user labels which further increases the recommendation accuracy.

#### The Theory and Method of Cross-media for Public Security (National “973” Program of China) (2010 - 2013)
This project studies some methods to discover the hot topics in cross-media data and visualize their origins and trends. In this project, I mainly work on cross-media representation and modeling, especially the fusion of different feature types and social contexts.#### D-Ocean: An Unstructured Data Manager System (HeGaoJi Key Project of China) (2011 - 2013)
D-Ocean([www.udms.org](http://www.udms.org)) is an unstructured data manager system which combines analysis and management together on large-scale heterogeneous data in the cloud. In this system, I focus on developing indexing algorithm for unstructured data and designing multimedia application demos based on this system.

#### Intelligent Weave CAD System for HongKong SML Group. (2007-2009)
This system is developed for SML Group from HongKong, which is the leading company in weave label manufacturing. I participated in the design and development of the graphical pattern design system and the intelligence expert system. In particular, I am responsible for creating a new language as well as its parser to describe the rules and algorithms in weave design.

#### P2P Music Sharing System for Xiami (2007)
Xiami([www.xiami.com](http://www.xiami.com)) is a popular online music community in china. At its beginning stage, I participated in the design and implementation of its p2p music share service during my summer internship. Besides, I also did some work on music compression and tag preprocessing.
